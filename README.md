This repo backs a series of blog posts providing a Web2py tutorial. The tutorial takes the readers from nothing at all to a rudimentary Twitter clone, called Witter. Part 1 lives [here](http://fragile.org.uk/2013/06/twitter-clone-tutorial-in-web2py-part-1-getting-started/ "Twitter Clone Tutorial in Web2Py Part 1 - Getting started")

Rather than cut and paste the code, readers can download the source and add the witter directory under web2py/applications/ then they need only point their browsers at http://127.0.0.1:8000/witter to see the the final state of the application.
